# DL-Photo-Restoration
# 🖼️ AI Face Restoration Using GFPGAN & Real-ESRGAN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project restores old, blurry, or low-quality face images using state-of-the-art pre-trained deep learning models.

It utilizes:

- **GFPGAN** for face enhancement and restoration
- **Real-ESRGAN** for high-quality image upscaling

The system runs in Google Colab and allows users to either upload an image or capture one using their camera for instant restoration.
